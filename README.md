# Preprocessor-in-C


<b>I will write a C processor program that expands the commands written with the $ sign in the c file.</b>

<h3><b>Approach:</b></h3><br>
We divide the project into 2 parts.<br>
The first part will the first part will open the target file and check if there is a $ sign in the file. When code detect the $ sign then it determines which command is written and call the function corresponding to that command. <br>
In the second part, we write code that the operations that the commands starting with the $ sign should do inside these functions.<br>


<h3><b>Example:</b></h3>
